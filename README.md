You will execute SQL queries to answer three questions, as listed in the instructions.


Q1:
Do more study hours and extracurricular activities lead to better scores? Analyze how studying more than 10 hours per week, while also participating in extracurricular activities, impacts exam performance. The output should include two columns: 1) hours_studied and 2) avg_exam_score. Group and sort the results by hours_studied in descending order.

Q2:
Categorize students into four groups based on hours studied per week: 1-5 hours, 6-10 hours, 11-15 hours, and 16+ hours. The output should contain two columns: 1) hours_studied_range and 2) avg_exam_score. Group the results by hours_studied_range and sort them by avg_exam_score in descending order.
